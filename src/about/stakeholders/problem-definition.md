pitch: Every impactful service begins with understanding the real problems faced by people. Please, help us define the right problem in terms of personal and professional growth, such that we can design a solution together, addressing your needs. You will find multiple ways to help us with this, at various levels of time commitment and detail.

### Problem statement - 3-5 minutes

Did you know, even stating the problem you face in terms of personal and professional growth, or supporting others with their growth helps us immensely.
A clear problem statement helps us identify **what** problem we need to address with our services, and it only takes 3-5 minutes to complete.

### Insights survey - 15-20 minutes

Our insights surveys help us understand the details of the challenges you experience, and aid our thinking on **how** might we design impactful solutions.
Please take 15-20 minutes to respond to our questions, at one of the surveys below, which best describes your perspective.

- [Your personal and professional growth](https://forms.gle/25Luuux5ai8YdNCW9) - for blind, partially sighted, learning disabled individuals and their parents, teachers, or carers.
- [Business insights (BPS)](https://forms.gle/haHn8AZJTtAJfhcW7) - for organisations supporting blind or partially sighted individuals
- [Business insights (LD)](https://forms.gle/nPek7h4HidyXpWsH9) - for organisations supporting learning disabled individuals

### Opportunity definition interview - 30-60 minutes

Sometimes it is difficult to express our needs, desires, and feelings in a survey.
Conversations help us understand **why** your problem needs a better solution.
To surface and capture the nuances of overcoming your challenges, we'd like to invite you to an opportunity definition interview.
It takes 30-60 minutes, and you can schedule the interview at your convenience using the tool below.
