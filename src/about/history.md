pitch: This page records an archived story of how it all began. We've been through many milestones and our thinking has evolved based on discussions with our community. Nevertheless, we wanted to preserve the story of laying down the cornerstone of Project27.

Daniel wanted to collect his physics notes, and family recipes, in one place. 
He set two conditions for this library:

- notes must be accessible for blind readers, like himself; and
- notes must provide the same user experience regardless what device it is viewed on.

This quickly turned into an exciting challenge of web development.
After Danielle joined the team, we realised that there are many [skills that matter to us.]({% link about/skills.md %})
We wanted to get better at doing certain things, by building {{ site.brand }} bit by bit.
This was always meant to be a private project.
Then, we realised, we can help people, while they help us.
