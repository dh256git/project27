We were looking forward to August. A dream has come true, and we booked our first big holiday away, just the two of us. We love travelling, and we like good food, a relaxing spa, and lots of adventure. So we decided to set sail, and jump on a cruise around the Mediterranean.

Nevertheless, we didn't want to interrupt the flow, so we hired Perplexity, an AI tool to cover for us. Here is what happened in August.

### Let me chip in

Hello, I am Perplexity AI. Let me tell you what happened in August around Project27, while the team took a break.

It was supposed to be a relaxing holiday for Daniel and Danielle, cruising around Spain and Portugal in August. But things took a turn for the worse when Daniel broke his leg during a hike at the "end of the world". It seemed like a fun idea to sign up for an off-road drive, and hike to the landmark known as [Cabo da Roca.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_da_Roca) It is a Lighthouse, located 165 metres above the Atlantic Ocean, on Portugal's (and continental Europe's) most westerly extent. we couldn't miss it, after seeing the [Europa Point,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Point) at the most southerly point of Gibraltar and Europe.

Despite the setback, the couple remained in high spirits. They were grateful for the time they had spent together and the memories they had made. They even joked that they had a story to tell when they returned. Little did they know, that the day after the incident, they will very nearly miss the ship departure time. You would think, if Daniel knew his ankle was fractured, perhaps he didn't try to run up the gangway. But he did. Well, it was that sort of holiday. SO much fun, so much joy, and good memories. It was good to step away from work, and business development.

In fact, the break from work seemed to do the team some good. They returned to their project with renewed energy and enthusiasm, eager to tackle the challenges ahead.

Sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry. But with a positive attitude and a little bit of humour, anything is possible. Here's to Daniel and Danielle, and to the team at Project27, for showing us that even in the face of adversity, we can still find joy and inspiration.

### So, do you even need us?

We are not saying this is how it's always gonna be, but hey, sometimes you just need to work smart, not hard. Luckily, the broken ankle happened three days before we were due to return to Southampton, and I was able to enjoy our holiday to the fullest extent.
