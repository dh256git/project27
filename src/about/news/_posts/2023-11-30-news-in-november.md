[Olli version 2.0](https://mitvis.github.io/olli/) debuted on 28th of November, and we couldn't be more excited.
To share the latest on the research behind Olli, we presented at the Information+ 2023 conference in Edinburgh.

### And finally we meet

Presenting Olli v2.0 and the various research projects behind the release of the new version is exciting enough as it is.
However, to top it, it also marked the first time Daniel and Jonathan, two of the research collaborators met in person.

We presented the concept of Olli, as well as new features, such as filtering and customising descriptions.
In addition, we spoke about the {{ site.org }} mission of co-designing solutions that work.
We only had eight minutes to speak, but we packed it with fun and useful info on accessible data visualisation.
