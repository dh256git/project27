June has been a quiet month.
So, we bought the equipment to make some noise.
<!-- excerpt-end -->

### Why did we invest in mics?

Reading long posts is not for everyone.
Most of us enjoy more when we can listen to a podcast, or watch a video.
We also want to learn how to capture stories in good quality, and how to share these with the world.

That's why we decided to buy two dynamic mics, a couple of stands, and an audio interface.
The purchase in itself, and the research before that was full of learning opportunities.
Do you know what's the difference between a dynamic and a condenser mic?
We didn't.
Do you know why it is better to use an audio interface, than plugging the mic directly into your computer with a USB cable?
We learnt just that.

Long story short, this month we began the journey towards satisfying our curiosity with regards to recording equipment.
We'll start to learn how to create engaging content.
We suspect, this may be something that our community will grow to appreciate too.
We can't wait to test our assumption with you all.
