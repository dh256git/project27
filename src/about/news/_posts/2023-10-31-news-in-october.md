Good bye dropdown menu and iframe, and hello tab panels.

Project27 has introduced tab panels on their profile pages to provide a better user experience. Tab panels are a powerful user interface component that allows website authors to present multiple panels within a single window. By selecting a tab, users can easily switch between panels and access the information they need without having to navigate to separate pages.

The use of tabs in the interface is an excellent metaphor since the general idea of tabs comes from interacting with index cards in a drawer of a card catalog, a real-world object most people have some experience with. When implemented correctly, tabs improve usability by making navigation experience more clear, improving content organisation, and adding visual consistency. 

Specifically, now visitors are able to view Daniel's and Danielle's profile in tabs corresponding to topics, such as education, employment, or achievements.

The introduction of tab panels on our profile pages is a step towards enhancing user experience and navigation on our website. This initial implementation marks the beginning of transitioning to tabs across our pages, where dropdown menus and frames were used. We hope that this update will improve the usability and user experience of our site.
