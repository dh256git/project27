We convened the {{ site.org }} advisory board for the first time.
Matching the frequency of these board meetings, we'll also share news less often.

### Welcome to our advisory board

One of the big mistakes I made as a co-founder of a previous start-up is not to seek systematic advice.
To avoid making the same mistake, we asked a few of our knowledgeable and experienced friends to check and challenge our thinking when it comes to business development at {{ site.org }}.
Such gathering of critical friends will happen once every three months.

The aim is for us to present our progress and how our thinking has evolved based on conversations with our stakeholders.
The board's job is to challenge our assumptions, and give critical feedback on our plans.
This should shape our roadmap, and help us articulate reasons behind our actions.

Currently, we asked a chairman, and three general members to set up our [advisory board.]({% link about/team/index.md %})
However, our intention is to grow and diversify the existing board by the end of 2024, engaging 10 board members.

### Seasonal news

We decided to share news less often, as we don't work full-time, and there are quieter months.
This change is also a good opportunity for us to sync up news with the quarterly board meetings.
Watch out for our spring, summer, autumn, and winter news in 2024.

Like this year, we'll share the news on our homepage, on the last day of the month, in the first month of the season.
We are also considering to spin up a newsletter that you can sign up to, such that news are delivered straight to your inbox.
We will keep you posted when this becomes reality.
If you are excited by this option, please drop us an email to let us know we should set up the mailing list.

### Merry Christmas and a happy new year

All that remains is for us to wish everyone a merry Christmas, and a happy new year.
if you don't celebrate Christmas, we wish you a restful end of 2023 while we take a break.
All the best from the Project27 co-founders.
