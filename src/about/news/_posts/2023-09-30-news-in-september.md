The artificial intelligence (AI) excitement broke through our doors too, and we started experimenting with tools that may help us in the process of building {{ site.brand }}. Our AI journey begins with [Grain](https://grain.com/app), a note taking application.
<!-- excerpt-end -->

The other day we were so impressed by the capabilities of AI powered transcription and note taking tools, such as Grain, that we asked ourselves "how can we use AI in our workflows at {{ site.brand }}"? For a start, we can certainly save some time, and become less forgetful by letting Grain take our meeting notes, and summarise the key action points. Here is why it's so useful.

### The benefits of using AI powered transcription services

AI-powered note-taking apps, such as Grain, offer several benefits, including:

- **Efficiency**: AI can process and transcribe conversations rapidly and accurately, saving time for professionals who would otherwise struggle to jot down every detail.
- **Accuracy**: AI can capture every moment of a meeting accurately, ensuring that every word and action is recorded, eliminating the risk of human error.
- **Reliability**: AI-generated summaries are usually accurate, and Grain takes it one step further by providing clickable time-stamps for each key point in the summary. This feature allows users to quickly review and edit details as needed by jumping to specific moments in the meeting recording or creating shareable highlight clips with just a click.
- **Improved productivity**: With AI handling note-taking, professionals can fully engage in the conversation, actively listening and responding to prospects, leading to a more enjoyable and productive experience for both parties.
- **Accessibility**: Meeting transcripts can significantly benefit people with hearing and other problems, as well as those with difficulty processing auditory information, as they can review the notes at their own pace and refer back to them as needed.

Overall, AI-powered note-taking apps can help professionals save time, increase accuracy, and improve productivity, making them a valuable tool in various industries.

### What's next for us?

Note-taking is just an entry point for us. We will explore how AI could help us with copywriting some of our less personal content, scaling our support services for members during active learning assignments, or assisting with our user and market research. It seems inevitable that we'll have to invest in understanding how AI tools can help us build a successful business, creating value and positive impact.
