## Why trust us with your talent

We help blind or learning disabled people to develop skills that matter.
{{ site.brand }} reduces the frustration caused by inaccessible learning tools, and builds confidence in your abilities.
We do this through peer support, personalised opportunities for learning, creating and discovering new challenges in a safe place, built by it's community.

In the background multiple signs are visible, such as logos of University College London, World Health Organisation, and GDI Hub. Other signs read 'AT changes lives' and 'Launching the Global Report on Assistive Technology'." %}
