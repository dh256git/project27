We are committed to certifying  the work and achievements of our community members.

### Before you become a member

We take onboarding very seriously, making sure everyone interested in our programmes are set up for success.
Trainees, volunteers, and consultants are all asked to take part in our onboarding, before they become registered members.
View the table below for details of the onboarding process.


{% assign dataFile = site.data.volunteering.certification-table-guests %}
{% include global/tabulator2.html %}

### Trainee development pathways

View the table below to compare what you need to bag a trainee certification, and what level of support you can expect.

{% assign dataFile = site.data.volunteering.certification-table-trainees %}

### Volunteer and consultant roles

We will also certify the work that our volunteers and consultants do across our community and projects.
Certifications can demonstrate your commitment for disability inclusion and experience of working with disabled people.
