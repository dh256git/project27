We are committed to certifying  the work and achievements of our community members.

### Before you become a member

We take onboarding very seriously, making sure everyone interested in our programmes are set for success.
Trainees, volunteers, and consultants alike are asked to take part in our onboarding before they are granted member status.
Expect the following, before becoming a registered member.

{% assign dataFile = site.data.volunteering.certification-table-guests %}
{% include global/tabulator2.html %}

### Trainee development pathways

View the table below to compare what you need to bag a trainee certification, and what level of support you can expect.

{% assign dataFile = site.data.volunteering.certification-table-trainees %}
{% include global/tabulator2.html %}

### Volunteer and consultant roles

We will also certify the work that our volunteers and consultants do across our community and projects.
Certifications can demonstrate your commitment for disability inclusion and experience of working with disabled people.

{% assign dataFile = site.data.volunteering.certification-table-volunteers %}
{% include global/tabulator2.html %}
