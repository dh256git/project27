### Things to consider before reaching out to us

We believe that a great onboarding experience is a must.
We are dedicated to welcoming you personally, and tailoring your journey to your needs and preferences.

Before reaching out to us, have a think about the following, and let us know:

3. How much time are you likely to commit? For example, if you are joining as a trainee what [level of certification]({% link volunteering/certification.md %}) would you aim for?
4. What's your motivation in joining our community? In other words, what would you like to get out of volunteering; or what skills would you like to develop as a trainee?

## What happens after you apply to become a community member?

Whether you join our community as a volunteer, or as a trainee, we will set you up for success.
We follow a six step onboarding process, over a period of six weeks,  to ensure you have a great experience of joining your team.

Welcome
: After you apply, we will review the information you shared with us. If your application is successful, we will send you a welcome letter, including your onboarding plan and a link to schedule your introductory meeting, during the first week of your onboarding.

Introduction
: You will meet the co-founders of {{ site.org }} on a 30 minute long virtual meeting to welcome you, understand your interests and motivations for joining our community, select your team, answer your questions, and set you up with your first task.

Meeting your team leader
: During your second week, you will meet your team leader for an hour to talk about our ways of working, and how you can adapt these to meet your personal preferences.

Picking your first trainee exercise or volunteer task
: Your team leader will have shared with you a list of exercises or tasks to choose from after your initial meeting. During your third week of the onboarding, you'll meet your team leader for another hour of mentorship, where you can pick the first task you will commit to completing, and discuss ways to complete this task, including the support you can get.

Feedback and progression
: The final week of the onboarding involves a 30 minutes long virtual meeting with your team leader and one of the co-founders of {{ site.org }}. You will discuss any challenges and successes related to completing your first task, working with your team leader, and your feedback on engaging with the wider community.

Your first junction
: At the end of your onboarding journey, we'll ask you to make a decision in your feedback and progression form. If you decided to continue with your growth journey as a member of our community, we will send you your registered member certificate and discuss your growth plan, including payment options. If you decided to take the exit, we will send you a farewell letter. Either way, this step is the end of your onboarding journey.

## Fancy a challenge to show your commitment?

There is an additional way to express your interest in joining our community.
You can download an application form in Markdown format, and return a completed copy.
We suggest that members interested in joining our digital team take this path.
It is a small, self-contained challenge.

By sending us your completed application form, you show us:

* how committed you are to learning, and taking challenges;
* how well you can create a screen reader accessible and easy read document, for blind or learning disabled people;
* how engaging your first {{ site.brand }} written piece is.

please download the short application form and e-mail it to us as an attachment. Our e-mail address is support@project27skills.com.
