## {{ page.title }}

Thanks for expressing interest in joining our community. There are multiple ways you can do so.

### Things to consider before reaching out to us

We believe that a great onboarding experience is a must.
We are dedicated to welcoming you personally, and tailoring your journey to your needs and preferences.
It all starts with a few simple questions.
Before reaching out to us, have a think about the following:

1. What's your name?
2. Would you like to join as a volunteer or as a member?
3. How much time are you likely to commit? For example, if you are joining as a member what [level of certification]({% link volunteering/certification.md %}) would you aim for?
4. What's your motivation in joining our community? In other words, what would you like to get out of volunteering; or what skills would you like to develop as a member?
5. What are your interests or areas of professional expertise? In other words, which {{ site.org }} team would you join first?
6. Why did you choose this way of getting in touch?
7. How can we get back to you? Please leave your email address or phone number.

## What happens after you get in touch?

Whether you join our community as a volunteer, or as a member, we will set you up for success.
We follow a light-weight, three step onboarding process to ensure you have a great experience of joining the team.

Registration
: We ask you to express your interest in joining our community, via one of the many alternative ways mentioned above;;

Introduction
: We organise a 30 minute long virtual meeting with you to make introductions, understand your interests and motivations, and discuss the tasks you would like to help with.

Quick start
: During your first week, we ask you to complete our quick start workflow, which involves reading through our 'getting started' package.
: A 30 minute long virtual meeting, to get you familiar with our systems.
: A second 30 minute long virtual meeting, to set you up on your first task.

Supervision (members only)
: During the first month with us, we offer a [free supervision session]({% link support/pricing.md %}), to make sure you can give us feedback, ask questions, and to help you combat initial difficulties.
: Supervision is optional and flexible. You can choose to take the full hour, take two 30 minute long sessions, or not use it at all.

## Fancy a challenge to show your commitment?

There is an additional way to express your interest in joining our community.
You can download an application form in Markdown format, and return a completed copy.
We suggest that members interested in joining our "research and development" team take this path.
It is a small, self-contained challenge.

By sending us your completed application form, you show us:

* how committed you are to learning, and taking challenges;
* how well you can create a screen reader accessible and easy read document, for blind or learning disabled people;
* how engaging your first {{ site.brand }} written piece is.

please download the short application form and e-mail it to us as an attachment. Our e-mail address is support@project27skills.com.
