We will try and unpack the concepts of version control, and its practical applications through a series of notes in this chapter.

It's difficult to write anything new on Git and GitHub, without sounding like we are repeating once again, what was said many-many times by other people on the internet.
Yet, we thought it is useful to put in writing our knowledge of these systems.
We use them nearly every day.
This digital tool enables us to collaborate, and make mistakes without irreversible consequences.

We only scratch the surface of what's possible using git.
Sometimes, we also forget how to use the less frequently used features of this tool.
