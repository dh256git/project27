> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

We will try and unpack the concepts of version control, and its practical applications through a series of notes in this chapter.

It's difficult to write anything new on Git and GitHub, without sounding like we are repeating once again, what was said many-many times by other people on the internet.
Yet, we thought it is useful to put in writing our knowledge of these systems.
We use them nearly every day.
This digital tool enables us to collaborate, and make mistakes without irreversible consequences.

We only scratch the surface of what's possible using git.
Sometimes, we also forget how to use the less frequently used features of this tool.
So the collection of notes are a reminder to ourselves.
We will touch upon skills and features that matter to us, features that enabled us to build this site.

Our notes are based on our personal experiences, as well as the very thorough
