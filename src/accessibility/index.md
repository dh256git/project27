## {{ page.title }}

This page describes how we intend to make this site as accessible as we can.

### Lived experience

We know what sets an accessible website aside from another.
Our goal is to make our pages as easy to use as possible.
We want screen reader users to get a great user experience, when browsing our content.
Similarly, we want learning disabled people to make the most out of the posted content.

However, it is often more difficult than it sounds to accommodate competing needs.
We are also learning newer and newer ways to improve accessibility, through principles of inclusive design and personal preferences.
As the site evolves, accessibility, usability, and user experience will also get better gradually.

### Reviewers and community support

We work with reviewers to review accessibility, before publishing our content.
For cases, when an issue passed through the filter, we encourage our community to flag accessibility problems on our [issue tracker.]({% post_url 2020-06-05-initialise %})

### Open source

We intentionally keep our website open source.
This means, any visitor is able to fix an accessibility issue, and propose it to us as an update.
For global issues, such as the footer on every page, contributions happen through forks of our [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/dh256git/project27)
For more localised problems, the link at the bottom of every page makes it easy to propose a fix.

### Specialist tools

When necessary and appropriate, we will research, develop, and use tools to make specific content accessible.
For example, where we are displaying a data visualisation, we are using [Olli](https://mitvis.github.io/olli/), to make the chart a joy to access.

### Automated tools for enhanced accessibility

Subject to funds available, we are committed to installing third-party tools, which enable users to set their accessibility preferences, such as their choice of font or line spacing.
For example, services and tools, such as [UserWay's accessibility menu](https://userway.org), or [AudioEye's accessibility toolbar](https://www.audioeye.com), may improve the user experience of our site in the future.
