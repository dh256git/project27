## What we do

We collaborate with academic research groups with an interest in accessibility , and deep expertise in one of our fields of interest.
This allows us to complement the respective expertise and interests during co-design research projects at the intersection of accessibility and mainstream research areas.

We also collaborate with pioneering businesses, who have an interest in disability inclusion and the early adoption of innovative solutions for accessibility.
This way, we create scaling pathways for successful research outputs on the market.
In addition, we help enterprise owners to address larger and more diverse customer segments, while end-users benefit from the commercialisation and dissemination of novel assistive technologies.

 - How can blind or partially sighted people access science concepts through haptic technology?
3. Access to civil rights and choices:
