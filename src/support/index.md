### Why get our support?

We know from experience that stories, guides, and courses are often not enough.
Sometimes we just need a little more ad-hoc, hands-on, personalised support.
That's why we come to you, listen to your needs and unique circumstances, and why we want to help through mentorship, coaching, and expert advice.

### What types of support are available?

Support sessions are personalised to your needs.
You can book single sessions, as and when you need us.
Through our [Skill Studio,]({% link support/studio.md %}) we can also help you select and schedule multiple type of sessions as a package.
Amongst others, we can provide support in the following ways:

1. Coaching: for anyone who wants to set clear goals, and discover options for barrier-free social participation, through open-ended questions;
2. Mentoring: for anyone who wants a 'tour guide' on their development journey, highlighting lived experience of disability and personal or professional growth;
3. Research: for answering specific questions on accessibility, where we might need to do a bit of digging to come up with a solution, or build a demonstrator tool;
4. Referrals: for those occasions we don't know the solution to your challenges.
