## Discount plans

We are a social enterprise, combining for-profit practices with nonprofit missions to create positive outcomes in a sustainable way.
We strive to reduce the cost of our services to end-users, through our blended finance approach.

### Where does the money go?

The funds raised through {{ site.org }} Support sessions and memberships are reinvested into maintaining and improving other {{ site.brand }} products and services, such as the [{{ site.org }} {{ site.product }}]({% link guide/index.md %}) and [{{ site.org }} Community.]({% link volunteering/index.md %})
We appreciate that the prices of our services may be difficult to afford by everyone.
That's why we are actively working with our partners and funders to buy some of these services on behalf of disabled members of our community.

### Tiers of our blended finance discounts

Our end-users always make the decision to invest their money in our services, even if it is only 1% of the full price of the membership.
