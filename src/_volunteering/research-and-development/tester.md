Biodiversity matters.
But some bugs must go.
Are you good at testing, spotting, and recording issues?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
We are looking for an extra hand with testing the site.
Test, locate, describe!
The more issues you can open, the better.
Before we can start debugging, we need a list of bugs.
If you can help, please do.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has past experience with testing websites, opening issues on Git Hub, or learns quickly;
+ can describe issues appropriately;
+ can test systematically.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ Testing CSS and JS related features;
+ developing an issue template for Git Hub and a good system of labelling bugs.
