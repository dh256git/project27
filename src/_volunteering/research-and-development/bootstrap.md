Could you make the {{ site.brand }} site look better?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
I just about managed to link up Bootstrap, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages, to kick in the {{ site.brand }} engine.
However, I haven't really spent time working on the visual appeal of the site yet.
In part, this is because I can not see the effect of any change I'd do.
In part, because all web style sheet solutions scare me. So really, the site would benefit from the capable hands of a web stylist, tinkering on visual design.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who

+ wants to get into web design and learn css, scss, sass, and Bootstrap for styling;
+ has a creative and artistic mindset;
+ catches onto a challenge, and doesn't let it go until the challenge is solved.
+ can learn and problem solve independently, though there will be room for collaborative learning and working. 

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ creating a unique, and consistent character of the site, by:
 1. populating content with graphical icons, and figures;
 2. designing and implementing a global colour scheme;
 3. designing and implementing the type and visual style of UI elements;
 4. improving the layout of the content.
+ enhancing accessibility and usability, by:
 1. making sure accessibility, and usability are kept in mind when designing the visual styling. For example:
  * graphical elements have suitable alternative description, ARIA labels are informative, and UI elements use standard HTML syntax compatible with screen readers.
  * The colour scheme has sufficient contrast, and the font size and family is appropriate for low vision users.
  * Content layout is convenient to access for people with learning difficulties or motor disabilities.
