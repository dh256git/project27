Do you value partnerships? Do you know how to build a good strategy?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
We will need to start thinking of partnering with others to accomplish our mission. We also need to think of the long-term play, while solving challenges relevant today. So if you know what an operational plan looks like, you can navigate legal documents and want to help our community, please volunteer. 

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has past experience with writing and enforcing MoUs, MoAs, and partnership agreements, or learns quickly;
+ can advise on recruitment strategy and talent acquisition;
+ knows what a business canvas takes to sketch and operationalise.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ developing the business model;
+ managing new and existing partnerships;
+ developing strategic and operational plans, setting objectives and performance indicators, and monitoring key results.
