Do you have experience in fundraising? Do you know how to file tax returns?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
I've got the basics covered, but a wizard of finance is always welcomed in the team. We would need grant funding, as well as private investment. We would need a method of managing income fairly. We would also need a way to be sure we comply with the bigger picture, i.e. file tax returns appropriately. If you are friends with Excel, please come and help.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has past experience with fund raising in the third sector, or learns quickly;
+ can file tax returns for ventures, without a problem;
+ can work out a strategy for a sustainable revenue model, treating our community fairly, while keeping the business afloat.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ defining the cost structure and revenue model, while working on financial forecasting and budgeting;
+ handling all financial matters, regulated by law, such as taxation;
+ pursuing grant funding and private capital to support our activities;
+ working closely with a team member responsible for operational activities.
