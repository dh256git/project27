Are you good with setting the right tone? Is the "social" gene in your DNA?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
{{ site.brand }} may have many projects to learn from, but we need an extra four "V"-s. If you know what the voice of a brand means, and you can sketch visually appealing stories, which are accessible and engaging even to those who don't get to see this; well, then you are welcomed in our team.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has past experience with digital marketing, or learns quickly;
+ has a talent and skill to create engaging comms pieces, while bringing the same voice to all of our output;
+ can define and impersonate an identity we all can affiliate with in our community.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ creating a public engagement and communications strategy, embodying the {{ site.brand }} identity;
+ advising our content creators and reviewers to producing brand coherent learning materials;
+ designing visual assets, layouts, and other hooks, which make learning engaging;
+ working closely with the team member responsible for sales and marketing on grabbing the attention of innovators.
