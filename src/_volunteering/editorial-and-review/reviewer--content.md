Are you good at spotting incorrect claims in maths and physics?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
With the best intentions in the world, even knowledgeable tutors of maths and physics can sometimes get things wrong. We know this, and that's why we rely so much on reviewers. If you have the knowledge and ability to correct false or misleading claims in maths or physics, please consider reviewing our MPS content.
#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has a good understanding of maths and physics at the undergraduate level;
+ is able to review written text, point out false information, and suggest corrections;
+ has the skills to scrutinise  learning materials with the eye of a teacher or tutor;
+ is familiar with LaTeX.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ reviewing existing notes in the [mathematical and physical sciences chapter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/MPS/index.html %}) of the {{ site.product }};
+ suggesting changes to text by editing content and creating pull requests.
