The background seamlessly transitions between a military base, a lush garden, and a cozy home setting, illustrating the man's varied identities.

Welcome to the identities blog category. The purpose, and thereby the content of these blog posts, is pretty straight forward. I wish to introduce who I am, what my interests are, and what I do.
<!-- excerpt-end -->

I believe that one's personality is composed of many identities. There isn't simply a him or her, there isn't a they. A man becomes who he is by being a lieutenant colonel, a gardener, and a father at the same time. It is good to have many identities, and being able to bring the right part of you to the surface when it is best suited to the place and time. When people say they know somebody, they probably only know a fraction of the identities of that person. 

I have many identities. These posts will try to depict a collection of them, which all make up my overall personality. To some extent I am a scientist, I am an entrepreneur, I am a guide dog owner, I am an ever-child, and I am many other things. However, all of these attributes enabled me to become who I am now. If you want to know me better, check some of these posts out.
