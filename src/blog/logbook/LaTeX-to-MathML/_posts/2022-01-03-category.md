This LogBook category will include a few technical posts, specifically focusing on the challenges and findings around LaTeX and MathML.
<!-- excerpt-end -->

The general goal is to be able to use clutter-free LaTeX source text within markdown content, such that the rendered output is MathML embedded in HTML content. The initial assumption is that we will mostly work with MathJax.

However, before we can dive into problem identification, problem solving, and optimising; I will attempt to explain the components of this puzzle through an initial "What is..." series of posts. This is because we need to understand, what is 

* LaTeX,
* MathML,
* XML,
* Javascript,
* AJAX, and 
* MathJax.

Once we understand the basic concepts and variations on these markup and scripting languages, we can investigate and experiment with the delicacies of converting LaTeX source to MathML output. For example, how to configure MathJax, such that it interprets delimiters of LaTeX equation environments the way we want it to be interpreted. In a future post, I will also discuss why we would want to do this.
