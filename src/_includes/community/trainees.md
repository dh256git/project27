## Trainees

Our trainees work in teams, on activities led by volunteers.
Activities help you develop specific skills, by completing tasks.
We guide you through training activities, personal projects, and {{ site.org }} community objectives.
When you become a trainee, you will

* get [certifications](#certification) for completing tasks;
* be able to join more than 1 team at a time;
* get 1 credit of [supervision support]({% link support/pricing.md %}) per month;
* get discounts at our community events.

## How much does membership cost?

Trainee membership is priced slightly differently, depending on the payment model you select.
We offer subscriptions, pay as you go options, and tiers of discounts to suit everyone's schedule and budget.

Our subscription model is a great choice for those who know exactly what skills they want to develop.
Annual subscriptions help you save, if you plan to become a certified fellow within 12 months of joining our community, whereas monthly payments help with breaking up the costs of personal growth.
Subscription costs are:

* paid monthly: £179.99 a month,
* paid yearly: £1799.90 a year (£149.99 per month),

Ownership of annual subscriptions purchased by businesses on behalf of their service users can be transferred from one service user to another on request.

Pay as you go options are a great choice for those who want to take their time.
You can take a break between working towards different levels of traineeship in the same team.
You can also aim for the same certification in a different team, without the need to level up.
Prices per certification are:

* Apprentice: £200 per month for 1 month,
* Intern: £180 per month for 1 month,
* Specialist: £150 per month for 3 months (£450 upfront),
* Fellow: £100 per month for 12 months (£1200 upfront).
