## Overview 

# Why should I contribute?

{{ site.brand }} is built by its community.
Here is why you should become a part of it:

1. We need your help. We are not experts or professionals in everything that's needed to keep {{ site.brand }} up and running. There is a lot to do, so a helpful hand is always appreciated.
2. Do it for yourself. We can guarantee, you will learn something new and useful.

# How much time should I commit?

The level of engagement is flexible. You may

+ identify, or ask us for a single challenge, solve it, and you are done.
+ continue working on multiple challenges, whenever you find time, even if only a couple hours in a month.
+ get hooked, and if you have nothing better to do, treat it as a part time role.

We follow a three step process to ensure you have a great experience of joining the team.

Introduction
: We organise a 30 minute long virtual meeting with you to make introductions, understand your interests, and discuss the tasks you would like to help with.

On-boarding
: During your first week, we ask you to complete our on-boarding workflow, which involves reading through our 'getting started' package.
: A 30 minute long virtual meeting, to get you familiar with our systems.
: A second 30 minute long virtual meeting, to set you up on your first task.

Supervision
: During the first month with us, we offer a [free supervision session]({% link support/pricing.md %}), to make sure you can give us feedback, ask questions, and to help you combat initial difficulties.
: Supervision is optional and flexible. You can choose to take the full hour, take two 30 minute long sessions, or not use it at all.
