## Join our community

{{ site.org }} is built by its community.
By joining, you will:

1. develop skills that matter to you, and your employers;
2. grow professionally and personally, through disability inclusive practices and active learning;
3. help other disabled people to become professionals.

The level of engagement is flexible.
You choose how far you want to go, and how much time you want to commit.

Guests complete our onboarding workflow before making any commitment.
Volunteers help with creating tasks, leading teams, and supervising trainees.
Trainees continue working on multiple tasks, committing time depending on the level of certification they aim to achieve.

For example, apprenticees commit to completing only four tasks a month.
In contrast, {{ site.org }} Fellows get hooked, treating task lists as a part time role.
