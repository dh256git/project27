## Why should I join the {{ site.org }} community?

{{ site.org }} is built by its community.
Here is why you should become a part of it:


1. We need your help. We are not experts or professionals in everything that's needed to keep {{ site.org }} up and running. There is a lot to do, so a helpful hand is always appreciated.
2. Do it for yourself. We can guarantee, you will learn something new and useful. Joining our community is the entry point of our active learning promise.

# How much time should I commit?

The level of engagement is flexible. You may

+ identify, or ask us for a single challenge, solve it, and you are done.
+ continue working on multiple challenges, whenever you find time, even if only a couple hours in a month.
+ get hooked, and if you have nothing better to do, treat it as a part time role.
