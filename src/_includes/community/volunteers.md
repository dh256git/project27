## Volunteers

### What are the benefits of becoming a volunteer?

There are benefits of volunteering in our community, even if you don't want to become a member.

<ol>
<li>
Learn new skills, or improve your existing skills.<div id="volunteer1"></div><div id="morevolunteer1">
{{ site.brand }} is all about learning new skills, and getting better in doing certain things, by practicing, and innovating.
The project offers a wide range of skills to pick up and nurture, and you get to choose which is most valuable to you. All that {{ site.brand }} volunteering roles do, is setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely) targets for you to work towards.

<li>
Use your knowledge and productivity output to help others.<div id= "volunteer2"></div><div id="morevolunteer2">
In the process of learning, you are also contributing to a shared vision.
You could learn on your own, and practice through your personal project.
Wouldn't it be more satisfying though, to help other people in the process?
There are no deadlines, no punishment if something doesn't work out.
It's learning through trial and error, and practice.
What we build together, ultimately helps communities of blind or learning disabled people.

<li>
Be part of a team. <div id= "volunteer3"></div><div id="morevolunteer3">
 Vibrant teams maintain a friendly vibe.
 There will be opportunities to be social by both digital and physical ways.
 Turn up for every, or every fifth team checkin.
 Stay for an hour, or drop in for only ten minutes.
 Being socially proactive is not a must, only an opportunity.

<li>
Satisfy your dopamine with an extra reward. <div id= "volunteer4"></div> <div id="morevolunteer4">
Are you the collector type, gathering and displaying credits, kudos,, acknowledgements, thanks, and all that jazz?

Then you'll also get the rewards on <a href="/about/team/index.html">our team page,</a> as well as in the inner circle of {{ site.brand }}.
