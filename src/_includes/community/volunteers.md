## Volunteers

Our volunteers are industry professionals, leading teams of trainees.
Volunteers are responsible for creating Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) tasks, and grouping these by activities.
Each activity associated with a team corresponds to a set of relevant skills.
Volunteers guide trainees in acquiring these skills, by advising on tasks to do, and ways to complete these.

Join our community, and you will be able to:

1. Learn to work with disabled people. You are here to learn too. As part of continuous professional development, you will gain first hand experience of disability inclusive co-working. Your role as a team leader will be a great opportunity to understand the needs and preferences of blind or learning disabled colleagues in a work environment. 
2. Share your expertise with the community. You are a valued industry professional in your field of expertise. Share some of your knowledge with the community of blind or learning disabled people, and help them become professionals too.
3. Become part of a team. Vibrant teams maintain a friendly vibe.
 There will be opportunities to be social by both digital and physical ways.
 Turn up for every, or every fifth team checkin.
 Stay for an hour, or drop in for only ten minutes.
 Being socially proactive is not a must, only an opportunity.
