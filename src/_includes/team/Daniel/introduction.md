## Introduction
Welcome, my name is Daniel, and the {{ site.brand }} vision is my vision too.

I was born in 1994 with healthy eye sight.
However, I do not remember what it was like to see perfectly.
I was very young when my sight started to deteriorate.
By the age of sixteen, I was completely blind.
Yet, with invaluable support from family, friends, teachers, innovators and technological advances, I was able to live for my passion - science, and maintaining human relationships.

I graduated as a theoretical physicist.
I went on and enrolled to study for a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction, specifically haptic interaction, applied to the field of science communication.
I am fortunate to have many valuable friends and colleagues.
I live independently in England, United Kingdom, and speak english as my second language on daily bases.

It was not easy to come so far.
I consider myself incredibly lucky, and merely clever.
I wouldn't be where I am now, without all the support I received, and now it is time for me to start returning the favour for anyone who might benefit from it.
This is why I created {{ site.brand }}, which is a place where I can start offering my support, alongside like-minded, talented volunteers.

The {{ site.brand }} Blog is where I express my opinion, insights, and experiences.
The Blog serves two purposes.

Firstly, to log things I learn during the development of this project, since learning never ends.
I started this project to help others, but also to carry on improving my own skills.

Secondly, I'd like to hint a key notion through the TWIST series.
A person is a set of identities.
As a good friend of mine once said:

> "Daniel, you are 50 shades of Daniel".

I want to show that, a scientist is not just a "scientist".
A blind person is not just a "blind" person.
I want to show, through my journey what any blind person can do if they find the way.
A blind person can cook delicious meals, a blind person can study and work in sciences, a blind person can be active in journalism and audio editing.
A blind person can also learn to programme, study human psychology, and perform statistical analysis for data science.

Some of these life style stories will come through the pipeline of the TWIST blog, and some through notes of the {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}.
If the Blog is where I offer food for thought, then the {{ site.product }} is where I wish to help people get things done.
My solutions are not the only path, but they are the ones that helped me overcome challenges; let it be a question in performing a scientific task, or a matter of lifestyle. 

The {{ site.product }} is a first small step in offering descriptions of ways to do things, even if one lives with a vision impairment.
However, as {{ site.brand }} evolves, I foresee the possibility of offering a more personalised support to individuals with sight loss and their families.
This might happen through online meetings or in person, in forms of tutorial sessions, hands on workshops, or simply a friendly discussion of opportunities and challenges.

There is one overarching theme though.
{{ site.brand }} is a place for life-long learning.
I learn, so I can create.
I create, so I can discover new challenges.
I search for solutions of challenges I discovered.
I constantly develop the skills that matter to me.
This is a source of enjoyment, a sense of flow, while I open up employment opportunities.

I truly wish that the content and the spirit of {{ site.brand }} will become not only my own, but a shared vision of many.
Get involved, to develop skills that matter to you.

So long, all the best!

Daniel
