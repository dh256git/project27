## Achievements

* I was awarded the "Leadership in Learning Disability and Autism" award by [Dimensions](https://dimensions-uk.org/dimensions-campaigns/meet-leaders-list-award-winners/find-out-more/enter-leaders-list/), in the advocacy, policy, and media category.
* One of my biggest achievements has been to carry the Paralympic torch from Abby Road to Lords cricket ground in 2012. I got the opportunity to do this by playing visually impaired cricket with the all women's team.
