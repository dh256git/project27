## Volunteering

* I volunteer with [Level 3](https://www.level-3.co.uk) - a festival of playful media for, and by autistic, learning disabled people.
* I am a [Look UK mentor](https://www.look-uk.org/mentoring/) since 2021. I help blind and partially sighted children get more confident. 
* I am a member at [Carousel](https://carousel.org.uk/), they have helped me get into filming and producing videos and teaching other people how to use different camera equipment.
* In 2017- 2018 I volunteered with an art group called MyMarc. This was an art group for young people with disabilities.
