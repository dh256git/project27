He is a great listener and he always tried to give the most informed answers possible to my questions and he was willing to share his personal experiences with me during our partnership. He was also a great role model for me in terms of what a visually impaired person can achieve. his support and finding about his experiences helped me a lot to build my confidence and encouraged me to achieve my ambitions.
