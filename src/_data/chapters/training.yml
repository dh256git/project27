  description: Our bespoke training activities help members develop the skills that matter the most to them. Trainees tell us what they are interested in, and we create tasks for them to learn from. Exercises of increasing difficulty are added to a private Trello board in our community workspace, enabling members to start and manage their own project when they feel ready.
