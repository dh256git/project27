Description of support,"Trainees seeking the apprentice certification work through tasks within training activities, supervised by individual volunteers, developing fundamental skills.","Apprenticees begin working on personal projects, practicing relevant skills while receiving guidance and feedback from community members","Interns join teams, and work on team activities. Team leaders and team members highlight opportunities for improvement, ask critical questions, but do not directly influence how interns should complete tasks.","To become a fellow, team leaders help trainees to become leaders themselves by encouraging specialists to take responsibility for specific activities, and recruit team members."
