Once you found a task you like the sound of, go ahead and bid for the task using the form below.

<p>Pro tip: Filter tasks using the label names, such as "#ResearchAndDevelopment" to find tasks relevant to specific teams.</p>

<h3>Can't find a suitable task? Create your own!</h3>

<p>
If there is nothing you like the sound of on our task board, we invite you to 
<a id="propose" href="mailto:support22970419+wtkcaqefrjih51ih5nsb@boards.trello.com">propose a new task</a>, that you would be happy to take on.
</p>

<p>You can do this in 5 quick and simple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Open a new e-mail, using the <a href="#propose">link above</a>. The "To" field will already have our e-mail address in it.
</li>
<li>
Type the name of the proposed task into the subject field of the e-mail. Come up with something short, but descriptive. 6-7 words should be enough.
</li>
<li>
Type the description of the task in the body of the e-mail. Try to keep it short (around 50 words), and answer these questions:
<ul>
<li>What do you plan to do? For example, fixing a bug, or implementing a new feature.</li>
<li>Why is this useful for the project? For example, what problem does it solve?</li>
<li>What do you expect to learn from the task?</li>
<li>How long do you think it will take you to complete the task? For example, 8 hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Send the e-mail, then check the task board. The task you proposed should be in the "new tasks" list.
</li>
<li>
Finally, bid for the task you just proposed, using the bidding form above.
</li>
</ol>
