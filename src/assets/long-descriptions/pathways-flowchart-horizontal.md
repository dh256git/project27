# Building pathways for growth

## Overview

The title at the top of the image is Bridging education and work experience. In its entirety the diagram shows different user journeys (depicted by cars) relating to building pathways for growth.

## Details of the figure

The following sections describe the diagram in detail.

## To the left of the diagram

To the left of the flowchart is the heading Complementing e-learning: mentorship and training. Under this are two columns of names. 

From top to bottom in the first column these are:

- Coursera
- Udacity
- EdX
- Skillshare
- Thinkific
- Udemy
- Edureka

In the right column, these are:

- Look UK
- GNYPWD
- Iota School
- Carousel
- Level 3 Production
- Amaze
- Blind in Business

Next to this section is the main diagram.

## Layout of the diagram

The diagram shows 4 pathways (looking like lanes of traffic) that go from left to right and cover about 80% of the page. Each of the lanes are labelled on the left as (from top to bottom) Team 1, Team 2, Team 3, and Team 4. Within 2 of these lanes are arrows depicting a user journey.
These are coloured differently and a key (at the bottom right of the diagram, shows these as:

- Explorer (red),
- Climber (blue),
- Navigator (green),
- Advisor (purple). 

At the end of these lanes on the right, the lanes form a circle (the top two lanes curve around the top of the circle, the bottom to curve around the bottom. In the middle of the circle are the words Building Pathways for Growth (with the icon of a workman). 

At the right hand side of the circle, are 4 arrows, one above the other, pointing beyond the circle to the right. 
Beside each of the arrows are words:

- Top arrow: Project27 pathway, work with us
- 2nd arrow: Industry pathway, work with industry
- 3rd arrow: Co-design pathway, work with innovators
- Bottom arrow: Entrepreneurial pathway, work on your idea.

Each of the 4 lanes is separated into 7 numbered sections (like milestones), which are labelled with numbers 1 to 7.

Above these numbers, are labels of different types of community members. These labels sit above different numbered sections as follows:

- Trainees: cover section 0 – 4
- Volunteers: this label sits above Team leader and industry professional and covers section 4 – 6.
 + Team leader: 4 – 5
 + Industry professional: 5 – 6
- Consultants: 6 – 7.

A small icon of a wallet with money flowing out is shown beside the word Trainees, while money is flowing into the wallet besides the word Consultants. A closed wallet with no money is beside the word volunteers.

Underneath lane 4, there are arrows pointing from the middle of each of the 1 – 7 numbered sections down towards the bottom of the page. 

To the right of the diagram is a key to the different user journeys as described previously.

## User journeys within the diagram

In the top lane (labelled Team 1), red arrows depict the Explorer journey. The car starts at the left of the lane and travels straightforward within its lane, from 0 to 1 (the start of the Trainee section). The car then turns right and travels through the other lanes to leave the diagram (with the arrow down towards ‘the exit at the bottom. A clock placed in each of the four lanes symbolises that explorers spend some time in each of the four teams, before exiting.

In lane 3 (labelled Team 3), the car starts at 0 and travels through sections 0 – 4 (the Trainee section). This part of the journey is coloured blue - the climber user journey. This journey symbolises that climbers stay in the same lain, and reach further and further milestones. Clocks at every milestone symbolise that climbers spend time reaching a new distance.

At milestone 5, a car travels down from the Team leader label, illustrated with green arrows, the navigator user journey. The journey continues within the Team 3 lane from milestone 5 to milestone 7. At milestone 7, another car travels down from the Consultants label, coloured purple, the advisor user journey. This lane continues through section 7 and then curves underneath the circle (with the Building pathways for growth label), and leaves the circle at the arrow ‘Co-design pathway, work with innovators.
