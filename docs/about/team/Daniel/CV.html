<h2 id="education-and-employment">Education and employment</h2>

<p>Let me introduce where I came from, what study and career path I’ve taken, and what causes interest me.</p>

<h3 id="childhood---path-to-university">Childhood - Path to university</h3>

<p>I was born in Hungary, where I lived my childhood. Prior to moving to Brighton (England) in 2013, I also lived eight years in Zagreb (Croatia). This is where I completed my secondary school education and obtained my diploma from the <a href="https://www.ibo.org">International Baccalaureate.</a> I studied in a highly international community, and started to develop an interest in sciences, such as mathematics and fundamental physics. In 2010 due to medical conditions I lost my sight.</p>

<h3 id="university---path-to-research">University - Path to research</h3>

<p>From physics to computer science, but science nevertheless.</p>

<h4 id="1-master-of-theoretical-physics-at-the-university-of-sussex">1. Master of Theoretical Physics at the University of Sussex</h4>

<p>In 2017 I graduated with a first class honours, Master of theoretical physics degree. Although fundamental physics studies was very satisfying and a great opportunity to acquire skills for solving problems, I also developed an interest in touch technologies. This has led to my early research interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and haptic interfaces in context of science communication.</p>

<p>As a transition from my undergraduate to PhD studentship, in my master year I focused on a science communication project under the supervision of <a href="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p114410-kathy-romer">Prof Kathy Romer.</a></p>

<h4 id="2-phd-in-informatics-at-the-schi-lab">2. PhD in Informatics at the SCHI Lab</h4>

<p>Between 2017 and 2021 I have completed a PhD in Informatics, under the supervision of <a href="https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/people/marianna-obrist">Prof Marianna Obrist</a> at the <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/schi/">Sussex Computer-Human Interaction (SCHI) laboratory.</a> My thesis discussed ultrasonic mid-air haptics in context of science communication. The research was funded by Ultraleap Limited.</p>

<h4 id="3-research-collaboration-with-the-mit-visualisation-group">3. Research collaboration with the MIT Visualisation Group</h4>

<p>After my PhD, I began a research collaboration with the <a href="http://vis.csail.mit.edu">MIT Visualisation Research Group.</a> Our research studies how data visualisations on the web can be accessible to screen reader users. Multiple research projects sparked from the initial collaboration. We published an open source accessible visualisation adapter, called <a href="https://mitvis.github.io/olli/">Olli</a>. In addition, we have explored the commercial viability of the research output.</p>

<h3 id="employment---path-to-career">Employment - Path to career</h3>

<p>I have had numerous paid employment experiences.</p>

<p>Since 2021, I am employed by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London (UCL)</a> to work with the <a href="https://www.disabilityinnovation.com/">Global Disability Innovation (GDI) Hub</a> as an innovation manager. My role is to operationalise innovation activities ran by the academic research centre and community interest company of GDI Hub.</p>

<h4 id="2-research-placement-at-ultraleap-ltd-october-2020--december-2020">2. Research placement at Ultraleap Ltd (October 2020 – December 2020)</h4>

<p>I worked for <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com">Ultraleap Ltd</a>, the company funding and supporting my PhD studies, for the duration of a contracted research placement. I joined the research team, investigating haptic perception and haptic technology. My role involved designing and running user studies on improved haptic icon recognition, based on some of my own prior research findings. I was also tasked with supporting various working groups across the company to implement research outcomes in product solutions.</p>

<h4 id="3-co-founder-and-ceo-of-grapheel-ltd-september-2014--october-2019">3. Co-founder and CEO of Grapheel Ltd (September 2014 – October 2019)</h4>

<p>After carrying out undergraduate research related to the concept of a tactile graphics Display to assist visually impaired science students, I developed the grapheel.com project (2014). The initiative matured into a scalable not-for-profit start-up, managed by five core team members (2017). Grapheel incorporated an R&amp;D scheme for tangible and haptic technologies; a Consultancy and Training scheme; and a Web Service. The mission of Grapheel was to advocate for accessible STEM education for the visually impaired.</p>

<h4 id="4-developer-and-consultant-at-it-foundation-for-the-visually-impaired-march-2016--october-2017">4. Developer and consultant at IT Foundation for the Visually Impaired (March 2016 – October 2017)</h4>

<p>I worked for the ‘IT Foundation for Visually Impaired’ (<a href="http://infoalap.hu/english/">Infoalap</a>, a Hungarian charity) as an Accessible STEM consultant and assistant software developer. My role was to assist a team of programmers in converting <a href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> and MathML source documents into audio and braille formats. Prior to this contracted work, I volunteered to test and enhance mathematical features of <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">FS JAWS</a> 17.0, one of the most advanced screen readers. As a result of my work, for the first time in Hungary, users of JAWS were able to fully and correctly access mathematics. I also authored a 70 pages training booklet on ‘Using LaTeX for accessible maths’.</p>

I have been responsible for all aspects of this series, from the initial idea, to booking and introducing speakers, to organising refreshments and advertising. I organised 12 lectures over two years. The series is still running, four years after I handed the responsibilities over. On a number of occasions, local radios asked permission to broadcast the talks. During the 2020 pandemic the lecture series transitioned into a weekly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/sussexuniverse">online talk.</a></p>
