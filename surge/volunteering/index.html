<p>Project27 is built by its community.
By joining, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>develop skills that matter to you, and your employers;</li>
  <li>grow professionally and personally, through disability inclusive practices and active learning;</li>
  <li>help other disabled people to become professionals.</li>
</ol>

<p>The level of engagement is flexible.
You choose how far you want to go, and how much time you want to commit.</p>

<p>Guests complete our onboarding workflow before making any commitment.
Volunteers help with creating tasks, leading teams, and supervising trainees.
Trainees continue working on multiple tasks, committing time depending on the level of certification they aim to achieve.</p>

<p>For example, apprenticees commit to completing only four tasks a month.
In contrast, Project27 Fellows get hooked, treating task lists as a part time role.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-membership-cost">How much does membership cost?</h2>

<p>Trainee membership is priced slightly differently, depending on the payment model you select.
We offer subscriptions, pay as you go options, and tiers of discounts to suit everyone’s schedule and budget.</p>

<p>Our subscription model is a great choice for those who know exactly what skills they want to develop.
Annual subscriptions help you save, if you plan to become a certified fellow within 12 months of joining our community, whereas monthly payments help with breaking up the costs of personal growth.
Subscription costs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paid monthly: £179.99 a month,</li>
  <li>paid yearly: £1799.90 a year (£149.99 per month),</li>
</ul>

<p>Ownership of annual subscriptions purchased by businesses on behalf of their service users can be transferred from one service user to another on request.</p>

<p>Pay as you go options are a great choice for those who want to take their time.
You can take a break between working towards different levels of traineeship in the same team.
You can also aim for the same certification in a different team, without the need to level up.
Prices per certification are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apprentice: £200 per month for 1 month,</li>
  <li>Intern: £180 per month for 1 month,</li>
  <li>Specialist: £150 per month for 3 months (£450 upfront),</li>
  <li>Fellow: £100 per month for 12 months (£1200 upfront).</li>
</ul>

<div role="tabpanel" id="tabpanel-volunteers" aria-labelledby="tab-volunteers">
  
<h2 id="volunteers">Volunteers</h2>

<p>Our volunteers are industry professionals, leading teams of trainees.
Volunteers are responsible for creating Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) tasks, and grouping these by activities.
Each activity associated with a team corresponds to a set of relevant skills.
Volunteers guide trainees in acquiring these skills, by advising on tasks to do, and ways to complete these.</p>

<p>Join our community, and you will be able to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learn to work with disabled people. You are here to learn too. As part of continuous professional development, you will gain first hand experience of disability inclusive co-working. Your role as a team leader will be a great opportunity to understand the needs and preferences of blind or learning disabled colleagues in a work environment.</li>
  <li>Share your expertise with the community. You are a valued industry professional in your field of expertise. Share some of your knowledge with the community of blind or learning disabled people, and help them become professionals too.</li>
  <li>Become part of a team. Vibrant teams maintain a friendly vibe.
 There will be opportunities to be social by both digital and physical ways.
 Turn up for every, or every fifth team checkin.
 Stay for an hour, or drop in for only ten minutes.
 Being socially proactive is not a must, only an opportunity.</li>
</ol>

<div role="tabpanel" id="tabpanel-teams" aria-labelledby="tab-teams">
  
<h2 id="select-your-team">Select your team</h2>

<p>When trainees join our community, they join a team led by a volunteer.
The team you want to join depends on your interests and motivations.
Team members work towards the same goals, defined by related team activities, with interns, scholars, and fellows learning from each other.

<h3>How do Project27 teams work?</h3>

Teams are the backbone of our community, where peer support is central.
We don't have roles, we work on tasks.
As such, we adopted <a href="https://mentorphile.com/2019/03/05/fostering-apples-culture-of-accountability-the-dri/">Apple's Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) way of working.</a>

Everyone in the team is directly responsible for the task assigned to them.
However, everyone has a mentor to learn from, and a mentee to support.
Scholars learn from fellows, while interns are guided by scholars.
When you become a team member, you can bid on tasks, using our internal system.
